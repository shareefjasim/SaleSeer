## 1. Key Decisions

### **AI-Driven Filter Integration**
- We will integrate an AI engine into the existing filtering component on the retailer’s website.
- The AI feature will observe:
  - Filter selections
  - Products viewed or clicked
  - Time spent on product pages

### **Chat vs. Button-Style Interaction**
Two options for user interaction will be offered:
- **a.** Fewer than 10 phrase-based button choices (e.g., “I need something that fits summer colors in X city”)
- **b.** A chat-based format where customers can type in their preferences and receive updated product filters in real-time

### **User Interface Simplicity**
- The system must remain simple and intuitive.
- Users should be able to get personalized suggestions quickly without feeling overwhelmed.

## 3. Requested Features & Changes

- **Dynamic Phrasing:**  
  AI should generate context-aware button or chat suggestions (e.g., “Looking for summer-friendly outfits in warm climates”).

- **Adaptive Layout:**  
  Filter options should dynamically rearrange based on AI suggestions for a seamless UX.

- **Personalized Recommendations:**  
  Top product recommendations should be shown first based on user behavior and input.

- **Multi-Language Support (Future):**  
  Consider handling multiple languages for chat-based interaction.

## 4. Clarifying Questions

- **Scope of Data Collection:**  
  Are we collecting only clicks and view durations, or also transaction history, search queries, etc.?

- **Button Phrasing Flexibility:**  
  Will the AI generate phrases in real-time, or will there be a fixed set of predefined options?

- **Chat AI Complexity:**  
  Should the chat mimic near-human conversations or just offer simple product-related Q&A?

- **Integration Timeline:**  
  Is there a deadline for beta vs. full launch?
