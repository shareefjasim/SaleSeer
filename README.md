1. Project Objectives
The SaleSeer project aims to leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) to serve as a virtual sales assistant by:

Accessing a Store’s Inventory

Integrate with a shop’s product catalog so that it “knows” the available items in real time.

Gathering Customer Preferences and Feedback

Ask customers about their preferences, needs, or past purchase experiences to recommend more relevant products.

Refining Recommendations

Use iterative question-and-answer sequences to narrow down or update product suggestions based on ongoing customer feedback.

Enhancing Customer Engagement

Provide a more conversational, personalized experience than static product listings, aiming for improved customer satisfaction and higher conversion rates.

2. Target Users and Their Needs
Shop Owners / E-Commerce Managers

Need: A scalable way to provide personalized product recommendations without hiring a dedicated team of sales representatives.

Benefit: Efficiently guides customers, reduces manual workload, and enhances the overall shopping experience.

Online Shoppers

Need: Quick, accurate, and helpful product recommendations.

Benefit: Saves time browsing large inventories and improves the likelihood of finding the “perfect match” for their needs.

Developers / Maintainers

Need: Clear documentation, easy integration with existing systems, and robust methods to update or customize the LLM’s “knowledge” based on changing inventory data.

Benefit: Maintains the project’s stability, ensuring seamless updates and improvements.

3. Key Deliverables
LLM-Based Recommendation Engine

A conversational AI component (powered by an LLM) capable of understanding and responding to user inquiries about product categories, specifications, and preferences.

Inventory Data Integration

A module or script that retrieves the latest store inventory (e.g., from a database, spreadsheet, or API) and feeds it into the recommendation engine.

User Chat Interface

A simple web-based chat or command-line interface for demonstration, allowing customers (or testers) to interact with the LLM in real time.

Feedback Loop and Refinement Mechanism

A function that captures user feedback regarding suggested items (e.g., “It’s too expensive,” “I prefer a different color,” etc.) and refines subsequent recommendations accordingly.

Project Documentation

A README.md file with setup instructions, usage guidelines, and developer references.

4. Special Constraints / Considerations
Data Privacy

Any customer information that is stored, processed, or transmitted must adhere to relevant privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, or other local privacy laws).

Regulatory Compliance

Certain product categories may require disclaimers or specific sales guidelines (e.g., health products, age-restricted items). The system must handle or flag these constraints.

Scalability and Performance

The system should handle multiple concurrent user inquiries with minimal latency. This may require efficient API usage, caching strategies, or load balancing if traffic scales significantly.

Accuracy and Reliability

The LLM should be regularly updated or fine-tuned to ensure suggestions remain relevant to the actual inventory. When the inventory changes, the LLM’s context or reference data must be updated accordingly.

5. Development Roadmap
Phase 1: Setup and Basic Functionality

Create the GitHub repository and establish the core project structure.

Implement a basic script to parse inventory data.

Integrate the LLM with a simple question-and-answer flow.

Phase 2: Interactive Recommendations

Develop a conversation flow that captures user preferences (e.g., budget, style, category).

Implement logic to refine recommendations in real time based on user feedback.

Phase 3: UI/UX Enhancements

Build a user-friendly web or chat interface.

Test for usability and accessibility to ensure a seamless experience.

Phase 4: Testing and Evaluation

Perform unit tests to confirm core features work as expected.

Conduct user testing or gather sample feedback to optimize recommendations.

Phase 5: Launch and Maintenance

Deploy the system on a chosen platform or server.

Establish a routine maintenance schedule, including inventory updates and ongoing LLM fine-tuning or version control.

6. Expected Outcome
By project completion, SaleSeer will:

Provide a Seamless Conversational Shopping Experience

Customers interact with the system naturally, as though they’re speaking to a knowledgeable sales representative.

Boost Customer Satisfaction and Conversion Rates

By narrowing down product choices quickly and accurately, SaleSeer helps customers make informed decisions, leading to higher satisfaction and conversions.

Serve as a Robust Framework for Future Expansion

The underlying architecture can integrate with various LLMs or expand to different shops, product lines, or languages, ensuring long-term adaptability.
